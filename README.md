## 📖 Overview

This project is a web-based **Decision Support System (DSS)** designed to assist small and medium-sized restaurant managers. By leveraging **Machine Learning**, the application analyzes historical sales data, weather conditions, and local events to predict future customer demand.

Based on these predictions, the system automatically provides actionable insights to **optimize staff scheduling** and **manage high-value inventory**, helping restaurants reduce costs and minimize waste.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🧠 AI-Driven Demand Forecasting:** accurately predicts hourly customer traffic and order volume using historical data and external factors (Weather, Holidays).
* **👥 Dynamic Staffing Optimization:** Calculates the precise number of cooks and servers needed per hour to prevent understaffing or overstaffing.
* **🛒 Smart Inventory Management:** Generates data-driven "Smart Shopping Lists" for critical ingredients to reduce food waste.
* **🗓️ Interactive Manager Dashboard:** A clean, visual interface for scheduling staff and monitoring operational efficiency.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The project follows a modular **Monorepo** structure:

* **🤖 AI Engine:** Python, Scikit-Learn/TensorFlow, Pandas (Data processing & ML Models).
* **⚙️ Backend:** Python (Django/FastAPI), REST APIs, Database Management.
* **🖥️ Web Frontend:** Modern Web Framework (React/Vue), Responsive UI Design.
* **📱 Mobile App:** Flutter (Cross-platform iOS & Android).
* **🎨 UI/UX:** Figma/Adobe XD (Design Systems & Prototyping).
